# **Project 1 - Cerberus**

> ***Cerberus welcomes you to the new era of web applications for educational management.***

## **How to use this demo**

First, clone this repository and run it using an IDE of your choice. Then go to 'localhost:8080' 
using your favorite browser. You will be met with a mostly empty page.

## **Generating test data**

You might want to generate test data. Click on the 'login' button on the top of the page. Login using 'admin' as 
username and 'admin' as password. You are now logged in as an admin. Then, go to 'localhost:8080/seed' to generate 
test data.

As an admin, you have access to everything this app has to offer. However, thanks to our military grade security, 
teachers and students have different views and access to different functionalities.

## **Logging in as an admin, teacher or student**

As said before, to login as admin, use 'admin' as both username and password. 
However, you, too, can experience what it is like to be a teacher or student! It's easy! 

First, click on the 'student' or 'teacher' button on top and pick a name from the list. For every name, 
the username will be the first letter of the first name, then a full stop, followed by the full surname. 
The password will be 'student' for all students and 'teacher' for all teachers. 

Here are some examples. **Please note that, since all names are randomly generated,
these exact usernames and passwords are unlikely to work on your local copy.**

*Teacher Example: Francisca Kutch*
- Username: f.kutch
- Password: teacher

*Student Example: Bert Treutel*
- Username: b.treutel
- Password: student
